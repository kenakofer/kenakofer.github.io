### Personal Projects


2014: Scholar's Bowl (Quiz Bowl) Buzzer Hub setup with timing, lockout, and advanced scorekeeping. This project gave Kenan experience with Python + Tkinter + Raspberry pi + 3d printed hand-held buzzer assemblies. Though the code and interface isn't pretty with hindsight, it was great practice for learning and exhibiting a finished product. Kenan's high school used the system for many of its hosted tournaments. [Github](https://github.com/kenakofer/pi-bowl)
