  "description": "An Arduino-controlled autoharp chord mechanism permits thousands of chords, while other autoharps max out at 21. The Arduino reads presses from a keypad, and maps them to a chord like B♭ or D♯m(add2). Two 8-bit shift registers control 36 solenoids in order to dampen the unwanted strings.",
