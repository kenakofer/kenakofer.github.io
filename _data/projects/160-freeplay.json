  "description": "An in-browser card table for playing arbitrary tabletop games with friends, made with a Flask backend and jQuery/Socket.io frontend. No rules are enforced or automated, but decks, dice, and private hands allow players to play as they would in real life. Developed before Kenan realized Tabletop Simulator was a thing.",
