  "description": "Loopsichord is a digital instrument for mouse and keyboard, featuring looping, colors and visualizations. It takes the layout of a piano into the second dimension by stacking diatonic scales, with related keys adjacent. A great way to play and discover that the key of C is no more fundamental than its peers.",
